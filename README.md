# How to Play

Navigate into the "match-match-game-main" folder. Then open the "tile_match_game" folder. In it, open "index.html". This will open the game.
The game has three (3) levels: EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD.
Each level will host one hundred (100) tiles in a 10x10 grid format.
In the EASY level, the grid will host 10 photos in 100 tiles (or 10 replica per photo), thereby having 5 similar matches.
In the MEDIUM level, the grid will host 25 photos in 100 tiles (or 4 replica per photo), thereby having 2 similar matches.
In the HARD level, the grid will host 50 photos in 100 tiles (or 2 replica per photo), thereby having only 1 match.
Irrespective of the level, a match awards ten (10) points, whereas a mismatch reduces two (2) points.
There is no time component.
To replay the game, the browser can be reloaded. This will restart the game from level selection step.
To restart the game, click the "Restart Game" button at the bottom of the play window. This will restart the game which is being played in that specific level.
To assist the player, a reveal/unreveal toggle button is available next to the "Restart Game" button. This will help to briefly locate the matching tiles. This button can be used ten (10) times in a game. However, when the tiles are revealed, a match could not be made.

# Special Effects

The game used animations and sound effects. Hence, it is best to use a hearing device for better experience.

# Build your own tiles!

You can customize the tiles by changing the input photos.
Use photos (in .jpg format) which are cropped off unwanted background and ensure they are less than or equal to (<=) fifty (50) kilobytes (kb). A website which can be used fr reducing photo size is https://image.pi7.org/reduce-image-size-in-kb.
Once the files are in the appropriate size and format, rename them as img1, img2, etc. upto img50 (in .jpg format).
These files can be used to replace the existing files in tile_match_game > static > img folder.
This folder is now filled with representative photos only.

# Customize your own game!
